# NED-Beta
Nonstructural Element Database - Beta version for internal development

## Overview
This repository serves as a temporary hosting and version control for the initial development of NED, the Nonstructural Element Database to support building-specific seismic performance research and assessment. NED acts as a relational database that collects information from experimental, anayltical, and historic performance observations of nonstructural building elements into seismic fragilities and consequence models for use in Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering. 

## Data Schema
NED's architecture is still under active development.

## Expected Final Product
Once initial development is nearing completion, this Github repository will be archived and replaced with a stable, web-deployed MySQL database and GUI for use by engineers and researchers.
